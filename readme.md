Observations:

- MC is almost as good as COBF at smaller paths (maxTicks <= 100), but quickly becomes too heavy to run
- COBF is great at longer paths, and is much faster than MC
- Greedy is not as bad as expected (usually ~90% of best)
- Genetic is bad, as expected, this isn't really the best situation for it
- Random is worse than expected, with an average score per cell of 25% of max across board
